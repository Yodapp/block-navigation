Block Navigation sidebar panel for the new Gutenberg editor.

== Description ==

Block Navigation provides a sidebar with the current post/page's blocks and some tools to facilitate the editing process in the new Gutenberg editor.
Inside the panel several utilities are included to enhance the UX, such as dragging blocks to a different location, moving them by click, selecting them, display a small snippet of the block's content, etc.
These functionalities are especially useful for nested blocks - blocks that are inside parent blocks which are difficult to select or move in the editor.
The plugin also provides some features for Plugin and Theme developers such as: click and Copy the block's clientId and click to console.log helpful block's data.
