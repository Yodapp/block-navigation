Block Navigation panel with useful features.

== Description ==

A Block Navigation interface to visualize the blocks from the editor and facilitate the editing process.
The plugin comes with several utilities inside the panel which provide a better UX, such as dragging blocks to a different location, moving them by click, selecting them, showing a small snippet of the block content, etc.
These functionalities are especially useful for nested blocks - blocks that have children blocks which are difficult to select or move inside the editor.

Until WordPress 5 is released this plugin depends on the latest version of Gutenberg plugin.
